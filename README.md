# MathMetrics
This project collects the quarterly Math test scores of the students at a Texas Middle School. 
From these scores, an analysis will be performed on the students primarily focusing on the achievement levels of two of the schools sub-populations, Black and Hispanic students. At the end of this analysis, we will be able to determine which Sub-Population performed the best and use this data to plan for the next steps for each Sub-Population as they prepare for their State Assessment. 

# Pre-Requisits 
Requirements for the software and other tools to run:

- Tableau
- Google Slides
- Microsoft Excel
- Jupyter Notebook
- Anaconda Navigator 
- DB Browser for SQLite
  

# Getting Started
These instructions will give you a step by step method to reading and understanding the analaysis:

# Step 1- Microsoft Excel 
Student/Testing Data was acquired via the software program Edugence through gpisd.org. 
This data was then exported into CSV Excel files for usage in Jupyter Notebook.  

# Step 2- Anaconda Navigator  
Anaconda Navigator must be downloaded and installed to be able to access the Jupyter Notebook option. 

# Step 3- Jupyter Notebook
Once Anaconda is correctly downloaded and installed, either create your own or use tbe base (root) environment to download and launch the Jupyter Notebook. 
This program launches in your default internet browser and once lauched, you can create a new "document" using the Python Programming Language. 
Python Programming language was then used to import the CSV files, convert those CSV files into Dataframes, remove the null value rows and columns, remove the columns not needed for this student, and finally merge the three CSV files into one final cleaned Dataframe that is then exported as a new CSV file. 

# Step 4- DB Browser

# Step 5- Tableau

# Step 6- Google Slides

# Running the tests
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
